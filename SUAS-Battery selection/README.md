By observing different parameters that effect the battery and power consumption, we drive the required mAh that can power the Hexacopter and full-fill the other power needs.

There is a phenomenon known as ‘Voltage Sag’ - The higher your throttle input, the faster you deplete your battery, but this depletion is not linear. At very high throttle the voltage drops even faster, but as you decrease throttle, the voltage will recover, the lower the C rating of your battery the more pronounced the voltage sag will be, and the longer it will take for the voltage to increase again.
With a high C rating, the voltage drop at very high throttle will be reduced. we should be looking at C ratings of 80-100C and higher for racing purpose.
                                Discharge rate(C) = current of Discharge/Rated capacity(mAh)

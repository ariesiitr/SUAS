# UGV (Unmanned GROUND VEHICLE) :
The UGV is a custom-designed vehicle holding a bottle up to the delivery location. It is the frame is made from 
carbon fibre to have minimum weight with maximum 
strength. It utilizes DC motors to transport the 8 
oz (236gm) water bottle. The water bottle is held firmly in 
place by the custom 3d printed supports and by some 
rubber bands as an extra precaution. It would be a four wheeled ugv with a wheel size of 7x2 cm each. In order 
to reduce the weight, the team decided to use a 600mAh 
LIPO battery, giving us the minimum power required to 
perform the mission. The 
UGV drive up to its destination is completely 
autonomous. The aforementioned UGV components 
were once again chosen to reduce weight and overall 
dimensions all while keeping the solution as versatile as 
possible.

# Gimbal
The camera is mounted on a two-axis Gimbal system using a STorM32 BGC control board and secured at
the bottom of the vehicle. The Gimbal provides the camera independence from both the roll and the pitch axis of the
UAV as the vehicle moves around the flight area. With this stabilizing ability, the camera can be kept focused
perpendicular to the ground, which makes sure that the center of the images taken by the camera match the GPS
coordinate that the UAV records.
